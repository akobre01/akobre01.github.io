I am a principal research scientist in [Oracle Labs East](https://labs.oracle.com/pls/apex/f?p=94065:12:34309819106958:7), which is based in Burlington, MA. I'm currently focused on building machine learning models that help developers find and fix software issues more efficiently. More broadly, I am interested in studying how computational tools--especially those that are powered by machine learning--can be used safely, and to promote social good. 

Before Oracle, I completed a Ph.D. at [UMass Amherst](http://www.cs.umass.edu) under the supervision of [Andrew McCallum](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~mccallum/). I received a B.S. in Computer Science from [Tufts University](http://www.tufts.edu) and worked as a researcher at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory](http://www.ll.mit.edu) building intelligent decision support systems. I spent the summers of 2014 and 2016 interning at Google. 

For a complete list of my publications, see [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p5P4vaoAAAAJ).

[//]: Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

[//]: Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

[//]: Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
