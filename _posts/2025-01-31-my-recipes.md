### Recipe Organization

**TLDR;** Here is a link to [my recipes](https://rocky-hardboard-38a.notion.site/af8a076a6c0d4f34b5ec2ffa63a6c64d?v=970daf92b89f4a03b62316ca98b3faff&pvs=4).

While I'm told that I make tasty food, I am not an exceptional cook. But, I have tried **a lot** of recipes. On top of that, I've built myself an easy, multi-faceted way to search through my recipes, and I can often do a good job of selecting recipes that match an occasion I'm cooking for and the amount of time and energy I'm prepared to spend doing it.

My recipe organization is built on [Notion](https://www.notion.com/). If you take a look at my recipes (linked above), you'll see that among other details, I record the name, link, and a personal rating for every recipe that I've made. This makes it easy to sort my recipes by those I like best. Additionally, I try to _tag_ recipes with descriptive words like: _Salad_, _Easy_, _Stew_, etc. to facility searching by the _type_ of food I want to make. As an example, in winter, if I want to make a soup, it's pretty easy to find soup options among my recipes and see how I've rated them in the past.

I come across new recipes _very_ often. These recipes come from friends who like to cook, my favorite food blogs (e.g., [The Kitchn](https://www.thekitchn.com/)), daily emails (e.g., [The Morning](https://www.nytimes.com/series/us-morning-briefing)), or recipe books **I've checked out from the library**.  When one of these sparks my interest, I'll add a recipe link (or photo) to my recipes and rate it &#x1F937;, which represents a recipe I've not yet tried. When I want to try something new (which is often), I'll deliberately search for and select from these recipes.

The last thing I'll point out is the _important ingredients_ column. This column includes ingredients that are uncommon in my kitchen (e.g., heavy cream). This helps me determine whether or not I can make a recipe at a moment's glance, rather than having to open and read through the full list of ingredients.

My list of recipes is always evolving! I'm constantly adding new recipes, rating recipes I've tried, and adding additional data to the table.

Happy cooking!
