	title = {Probabilistic Reasoning about Human Edits in Information Integration},
	abstract = {We present a probabilistic framework for knowledge base (KB) management that allows users to correct data integration errors in the KB. Rather than allowing users to directly edit the KB, we instead treat user edits as assertions on the truth about the entities and relations in the KB. Probabilistic inference then considers the user assertions along with all other available evidence in order to predict the true data values in the KB (and jointly infer the reliabilities of the contributing users). We evaluate our approach on a bibliographic database of computer science authors and show that our system is more effective at correcting entity attribute and coreference errors than traditional approaches that grant users the ability to directly edit the database.},

	title = {Large-scale author coreference via hierarchical entity representations},
	abstract = {Large-scale author coreference, the problem of ascribing research papers to real-world authors in bibliographic databases, is critical for mining the scientific community. However, traditional pairwise approaches, which measure coreference similarity between pairs of author mentions, scale poorly to large databases; and streaming approaches, which lack the ability to retroactively correct errors, can suffer from chronically low accuracy. In this paper we present a hierarchical model for solving author coreference that overcomes these issues. First, our model enables scalability over rich entity representations by compactly organizing the mentions of each author into trees. Second, we employ Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference which is able to retroactively correct existing coreference errors when processing new mentions. We validate these two properties empirically, and demonstrate further scalability through asynchronous parallel MCMC (allowing us to scale to all 150,000,000 author mentions in Web of Science).},
